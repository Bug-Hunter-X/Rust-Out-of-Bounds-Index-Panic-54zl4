# Rust Out-of-Bounds Index Panic
This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Rust: panicking due to an out-of-bounds index when accessing a vector.

The `bug.rs` file contains code that will panic when executed. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version using safe indexing methods.

This example highlights the importance of carefully handling array and vector indices in Rust to prevent unexpected program termination.
